                In 1985 after splitting up with IBM Microsoft had<br>
                finished developing their new operating system <br>
                called Windows which was a visual version of <br>
                MS-DOS. The os was released to mixed reviews of <br>
                people saying it used too much ram was really <br>
                slow. During the development, the team was behind <br>
                windows was under a lot of stress leading them <br>
                to release a product was generally negative <br>
                received. But this changed with the release of <br>
                Windows 3.1 which was released to critical<br>
                Acclaim as it was the first version of Windows to<br>
                truly be user-friendly leading to an influx of <br>
                people making more intuitive apps for the os this <br>
                created a state of innovation in the technology<br>
                sector in Washington state. Over time Microsoft has <br>
                boosted the growth of other companies and<br>
                industries in Washington state through funding <br>
 	            and support like those involved in cloud <br>
                computing and other technology-related <br>
                services as well as startups creating a thriving <br>
                and expansive technology ecosystem in the state.<br>
	            After the success of  Windows 3.1 other companies<br>
	            in the tech industry came to Washington in order<br>
 	            to try and replicate the same success that Microsoft<br>
	            with their products. Leading to the creation of <br>
	            hundreds of start-ups, supporting industries, and <br>
	            lots and lots of tech companies turning <br>
	            Washington into the tech hub we know today.<br>
