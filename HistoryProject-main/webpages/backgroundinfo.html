                students at Harvard who were interested in making<br>
                software for a newly released personal computer<br>
                called the altair 8800. Later the company that<br>
                created the altair MITS decided to hire Bill and <br>
                Paul to work for them. After leaving the company in <br>
                1979 they relocated to Bellevue Washington having <br>
                founded Microsoft just 4 years prior  to the move <br>
                they signed a deal with IBM to design a new operating <br>
                system (86-QDOS) to run on their new personalcomputer.<br> 
                Then in 1981 when microsoft was supposed to make <br>
                another os with IBM there were complications and they<br>
                ended up breaking ties in 1982. Leaving microsoft own <br>
                theirown and IBM to finish development on their os. <br>
                Microsoft would spend they next few years developing <br>
                own operating system called windows which was a GUI <br>
                extension for MS-DOS that would go on to make waves <br>
                in the tech industry as well as billions for <br>
                the soon to be tech giant, Microsoft.<br>
