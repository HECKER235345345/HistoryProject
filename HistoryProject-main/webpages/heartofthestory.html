                Microsoft has had a enormous impact on Washington <br>
                state from providing over 50,000 jobs in the <br>
                state alone to skyrocketing the Washingtons <br>
                development after the devastating boeing bust.<br> 
                Ever since Microsoft moved to Washington its had <br>
                a huge impact on the states economy bringing <br>
                billions in revenue every year. The state has <br>
                also become the developers dream because of the <br>
                thriving technological ecosystem Microsoft has <br>
                created. The Presence of Microsoft in the state <br>
                has created thousands of high quality jobs in <br>
                Washington, as well as impacting the community <br>
                through philanthropy and charity donating <br>
                millions of dollars towards health care and <br>
                education.<br>
