                Bill gates and Paul Allen where two computer science<br>
                students at Harvard who were interested in making <br>
                software for a newly released personal computer <br>
                called the altair 8800. Later the company that <br>
                created the altair MITS decided to hire Bill and Paul<br> 
                to work for them. After leaving the company in 1979 <br>
                they relocated to Bellevue Washington having founded <br>
                Microsoft just 4 years prior  to the move they signed<br>
                a deal with IBM to design a new operating system (86-QDOS)<br>
                to run on their new personalcomputer. Then in 1981 when<br>
                microsoft was supposed to make another os with IBM there <br>
                were complications and they ended up breaking ties in 1982. Leaving microsoft own their <br>
                own and IBM to finish development on their os. Microsoft would spend they next few years<br>
                developing own operating system called windows which was a GUI extension for MS-DOS that<br> 
                would go on to make waves in the tech industry.<br>
